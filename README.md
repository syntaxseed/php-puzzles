# PHP Puzzles

A monthly column originally published for [PHP Architect Magazine](https://www.phparch.com/community/sherri-wheeler/). Each month I present a new coding challenge, and I offer a couple solutions the following month.

This repo contains monthly solution code.

**No Peeking!**

Try not to peek ahead at months you haven't read or solved yet!

Join us on the PHP Arch Discord to discuss solutions. :)
